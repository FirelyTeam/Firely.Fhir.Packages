# Version 2.0
Major rewrite.
Introduction of scope to group Project, Cache and Server.


# Version 2.1 probably

## Breaking changes
The install command only installed into the cache. Not in the project.
To remove this confusion in the future, we renamed that method to CacheInstall
The Install command now also installs into the project.
